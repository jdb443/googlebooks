React Reading List App with simple Auth

### sample .env file:
```
APP_SECRET=s0m3s3cr3tk3y*
```
#test here

#circleCI notes
- once our tests are added, need to change line 23 of config.yml to run "start-server-and-test ..." like this "https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/continuous-integration.html#Boot-your-server"
